* There's no local repository locking. If another process writes to the
  repository while the HTTP server is active, it might serve the wrong
  contents. If the OSTree repo locking API is made public, the local
  repo should be locked while the push is happening. In practice this
  shouldn't be an issue since you're unlikely to be making commits into
  a shared repo.
