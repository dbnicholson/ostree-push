# 1.2.0 (2024-01-20)

* ostree-push now waits for the SSH master process to exit and kills it
  if necessary. This should help in situations where the process is slow
  to exit and its temporary socket is deleted before that happens.
  Thanks to Emanuele Aina for the fix.

* ostree-receive has gained support for pre-0.1.1 ostree-push clients.
  This allows deployments using the old protocol to upgrade ostree-push
  on clients and servers independently. The ostree-receive entry point
  on the server will now detect if the client is attempting to push
  using the old or new processes and dispatch accordingly. Moving
  forward, ostree-push will attempt to push to a versioned
  ostree-receive on the server to ensure it's using a compatible
  version. The old protocol support will be removed in a later version
  after deployments have been given time to migrate to the new tunneled
  pull process. Thanks to Emanuele Aina for diagnosing the problem and
  implementing a compatibility scheme. See #11 for details.

# 1.1.0 (2022-12-02)

ostree-receive now supports optional per-repository configuration. This
is useful if you have repositories that require different settings such
as the key IDs to sign commits with.

# 1.0.1 (2022-10-27)

ostree-receive now supports ostree ed25519 signing and verification. See
the example ostree-receive.conf for details on the configuration. Thanks
to Ryan Gonzalez for the contribution!

# 1.0.0 (2022-06-30)

ostree-receive now supports GPG verification of received commits. It now
supports all the features I need from it, so let's call it 1.0.0!

# 0.1.1 (2022-04-06)

* An alternate repository root can be configured for ostree-receive.
* ostree-receive now supports GPG signing of commits and repo metadata.
* A repo update hook can now be configured to customize the post-commit
  process in ostree-receive.

# 0.1.0 (2022-03-04)

ostree-receive now reads configuration files for options. See the
example ostree-receive.conf for details on the supported options.

# 0.0.1 (2021-05-27)

This is a rewrite of ostree-push and ostree-receive roughly as we've
been using it in Endless for several years.
